  <h5 class="card-title">Node.js Introduction</h5>
  <p class="card-text">

   What is Node.js?

  <ol>

    <li>Node.js is an open source server environment</li>
    <li>Node.js is free</li>
    <li>Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)</li>
    <li>Node.js uses JavaScript on the server</li>
  
    <li>Sends the task to the computer's file system.</li>
    <li>Ready to handle the next request</li>
    <li>When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.</li>
    <li>Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!</li>
  
  </ol>

  Can design a REST API.

  <ol>
  <li> There are several ways to call REST APIs.</li>
  <li>You can use the fetch web API, which comes by default in all major web browsers.</li>
  <li>There are node packages like axios and got that let you call a REST API with different HTTP methods.</li>
  <ls>All these ways are pretty simple and easy to use</ls>

</ol>

Intro Exercises

<ol>
<li>Can create package.json by hand and add packages to it manually.</li>
<li>
    
   For this exercise, we are going to build a simple command line tool which allows us to make a request to an API and store the data in a text file! We will be using the following modules.
</li>
</ol>

First Server

<ol>
    A callback is a function which is called when a task is completed, thus helps in preventing any kind of blocking and a callback function allows other code to run in the meantime. Callback is called when task get completed and is asynchronous equivalent for a function
</ol>
<ol>the POST method is used to send data to an endpoint while the GET method is used to request data from the endpoint. If you need to send specific data to your endpoint use query parameters. The access it on your endpoint for your server side logic.
</ol>

<ol>
    <li>HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages, with HTML you can create your own Website.</li>
    <p>Importing and exporting.</p>
    <li>Node. js also allows importing and exporting functions and modules. Functions in one module can be imported and called in other modules saving the effort to copy function definitions into the other files. The module can be edited or debugged separately making it easier to add or remove features.</ls>
</ol>

Full CRUDable REST API


<ol>
    <ls>CRUD is an acronym that stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. These four database commands are the foundation of CRUD. This acronym is well-known among programmers, but many software developers view it as more of guidance since CRUD was not made as a modern way to create API.</ls>
<ls>HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a variety of devices.</ls>
</ol>


Fetching and redirecting

<ol>
    <ls>Understands the difference between client-side redirection and server-side redirection.
        Billedresultat for difference between client-side redirection and server-side redirection.
        Server. Transfer doesn't change the URL in the client browser, so effectively the browser does not know you changed to another server-side handler. Response. Redirect tells the browser to move to a different page, so the url in the titlebar changes.</ls>
</ol>


SSR

<ol>
    <ls>
        SSR just means that the page's HTML is pre-generated on the server, and then sent to the client. As opposed to CSR where the page's HTML is generated on the client. The rendering always happens on the client in both scenarios
    </ls>
</ol>


More template engine + Starting Svelte

<ol>
    <ls> server. The express. Router() function is used to create a new router object. This function is used when you want to create a new router object in your program to handle requests.</ls>
<ls>Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app.</ls>
</ol>
